## About The App

`utrend` is an all-in-one, AI-powered content suite designed to help YouTube and TikTok creators ideate, strategize, create, and grow their channels. Powered by Google's Gemini API, `utrend` provides a comprehensive toolkit to help you stay ahead of the curve, from discovering real-time trends to generating production-ready video scripts and assets.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

This is a modern, no-build-step React application. You can run it directly in a browser that supports ES modules and import maps.

### Prerequisites

-   A modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
-   A local web server. If you don't have one, you can use `npx serve`.

### Setup & Running

1.  **API Key Configuration:**
    > **IMPORTANT:** This project requires an API key from Google AI Studio to interact with the Gemini API.
    
    The application is configured to read the API key from an environment variable named `API_KEY`. You must ensure this variable is set and accessible in the environment where you serve the application.

2.  **Serve the project folder:**
    Open your terminal in the project's root directory and run the following command:
    ```bash
    npx serve
    ```

3.  **Open in browser:**
    Open your browser and navigate to the local address provided by the server (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`). The application should now be running.

## ðŸ’» Technology Stack

- **Core Framework:** React (via CDN)
- **Language:** TypeScript (transpiled in-browser by the execution environment)
