## ▶️ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes `npm`) installed on your computer.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Download Project Files:**
    Download and unzip all the application files into a single folder on your machine.

2.  **Set Up Environment Variables:**
    > **IMPORTANT:** This project requires an API key from Google AI Studio to interact with the Gemini API.
    >
    The application is configured to read `process.env.API_key` directly from the execution environment. For local development, you should:
    - Create a new file named `.env` in the root of your project directory.
    - Add your API key to this file:
      ```
      API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
      ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    This project uses a modern setup where dependencies are managed by the execution environment. **No `npm install` command is necessary.**

### Running the Application

This project is a modern frontend application and can be run with any simple local web server. The easiest way is using the `serve` package.

1.  **Open your terminal** and navigate to the project's root directory:
    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/edgtec-folder
    ```

2.  **Run the app** using `npx` (this runs `serve` without a global installation):
    ```bash
    npx serve .
    ```

3.  Open your browser and navigate to the local address provided in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:3000`). The application should now be running.
