## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. These steps are compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### Prerequisites

You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes `npm`) installed on your computer. You can download it from the official website.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Download the Project Files:**
    Since this project is not in a public repository, start by downloading and unzipping all the application files into a single folder on your machine.

2.  **Set Up Environment Variables:**
    This project requires an API key from Google AI Studio to interact with the Gemini API. The application is configured to read `process.env.API_KEY` directly from the execution environment. In a real-world development scenario, you would:
    - Create a new file named `.env` in the root of your project directory.
    - Add your API key to this file:
      ```
      API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
      ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    This project uses a modern setup where dependencies are managed by the execution environment. No `npm install` command is necessary.

### Running the Application

Since this project is a modern frontend application, you can run it using any simple local web server. The easiest way is using the `serve` package.

1.  **Open your terminal or command prompt.**

2.  **Navigate to the project's root directory:**
    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/utrend-folder
    ```

3.  **Run the app using `npx` (this downloads and runs `serve` without a global installation):**
    ```bash
    npx serve .
    ```

4.  Open your browser and navigate to the local address provided in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:3000`). The application should now be running.
